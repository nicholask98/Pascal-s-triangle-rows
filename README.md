# Pascal's-triangle-rows
 
### Challenge:
Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

Each number is the two numbers above it added together

* Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

## Most Recent Update: EUREKA!

It's a little hacky but I got the function to produce the correct output! I start the function pre-for-loop with a print(1) to get the correct first line, and I have the nested if statement print a 1 before iterating through the row_list_current. Does not print as a list any more due to the nested for loop.

All that's left is to align in aesthetically!


### Last Update:

It works now except for the first 1 in each line and the correct spacing.
Also, it still has the []'s from the lists and it would be better if it didn't.
