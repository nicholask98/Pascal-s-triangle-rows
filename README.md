# Pascal's-triangle-rows
 
### Challenge:
Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

Each number is the two numbers above it added together

* Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

## Most Recent Update:
It works now except for the first 1 in each line and the correct spacing.
Also, it still has the []'s from the lists and it would be better if it didn't.
